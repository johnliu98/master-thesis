    abstract = {Tight performance specifications in combination with operational
                constraints make model predictive control (MPC) the method of
                choice in various industries. As the performance of an MPC
                controller depends on a sufficiently accurate objective and
                prediction model of the process, a significant effort in the MPC
                design procedure is dedicated to modeling and identification.
                Driven by the increasing amount of available system data and
                advances in the field of machine learning, data-driven MPC
                techniques have been developed to facilitate the MPC controller
                design. While these methods are able to leverage available data,
                they typically do not provide principled mechanisms to
                automatically trade off exploitation of available data and
                exploration to improve and update the objective and prediction
                model. To this end, we present a learning-based MPC formulation
                using posterior sampling techniques, which provides finite-time
                regret bounds on the learning performance while being simple to
                implement using off-the-shelf MPC software and algorithms. The
                performance analysis of the method is based on posterior sampling
                theory and its practical efficiency is illustrated using a
                numerical example of a highly nonlinear dynamical car-trailer
                system.},

    abstract = {Neutrino oscillation experiments presently suggest that
                neutrinos have a small but finite mass. If neutrinos have mass,
                there should be a Lorentz frame in which they can be brought to
                rest. This paper discusses how Wigner’s little groups can be used
                to distinguish between massive and massless particles. We derive
                a representation of the SL(2,c) group which separates out the two
                sets of spinors: one set is gauge dependent and the other set is
                gauge invariant and represents polarized neutrinos. We show that
                a similar calculation can be done for the Dirac equation. In the
                large-momentum/zero-mass limit, the Dirac spinors can be
                separated into large and small components. The large components
                are gauge invariant, while the small components are not. These
                small components represent spin-1/2 non-zero-mass particles. If
                we renormalize the large components, these gauge invariant
                spinors represent the polarization of neutrinos. Massive
                neutrinos cannot be invariant under gauge transformations.},

                is the first, timely replacement of only the liner is socially

                increasing as younger and more active patients are receiving
                implants and they are living longer. Automatic algorithms were
                developed to infer liner wear by estimating the separation
                between the acetabular cup and femoral component head given a
                computed tomography (CT) volume. Two series of CT volumes of a
                hip phantom were acquired with the femoral component head placed
                at 14 different positions relative to the acetabular cup. The
                mean and standard deviation (SD) of the diameter of the
                acetabular cup and femoral component head, in addition to the
                range of error in the expected wear values and the repeatability
                of all the measurements, were calculated. The algorithms resulted
                in a mean (±SD) for the diameter of the acetabular cup of 54.21 (
                ±0.011) mm and for the femoral component head of 22.09 (±0.02)
                mm. The wear error was ±0.1 mm and the repeatability was 0.077
                mm. This approach is applicable clinically as it utilizes readily
                available computed tomography imaging systems and requires only
                five minutes of human interaction.},
