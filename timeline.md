# Master Thesis Timeline

* Week 1-6:
 - Literature study.
 - Experiment in practice with the theory presented in the literature.
 - Narrow the research field.
* Week 7-8:
 - Design a learning controller and a predictive safety filter on a simulated pendulum system to get a better feel for how the theory work in practice.
 - Prepare mid-term presentation
* Week 9-12:
 - Apply the safe learning controller on the Einride pod in a simulation.
* Week 13-16:
 - Tune, test and evaluate the safe learning controller.
 - Maybe, maybe even apply the safe learning controller on the real Einride pod.
* Week 17-20:
 - Finalize report and presentation.
